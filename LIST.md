# Zane's project directory

I've attempted to compile a list of all my projects with publicly accessible endpoints, so you can check to see that I can actually do the things that I say I can do. Hopefully over time, more of my old projects will make it onto this list as I get around to either making them publicly available or they get published or whatever so can be released from private repos.

Since people only tend to read the beginning of stuff, the more impressive projects are at the top.

* [My website code](https://github.com/wzbillings/quarto-website): Quarto websites, blog posts, etc.
* [Modern Applied Data Analysis profile](https://github.com/wzbillings/ZaneBillings-MADA-portfolio-2021): `R` programming, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, machine learning, R Markdown websites.
* [PyTorch notes](https://github.com/wzbillings/cooperative-cobra): `Python` programming, PyTorch, scikit-learn.
* [SAS grain price modeling](https://github.com/wzbillings/SAS-Grain-Prices): `SAS` programming, exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, regression modeling, MESSY data cleaning and wrangling.
* [SR Notes](https://github.com/wzbillings/SR-notes): `R`, `Stan`, base `R` graphics, Bayesian statistics, (Bayesian) hierarchical linear (regression) models, statistical inference, Quarto books
* [Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way](https://github.com/wzbillings/DBSFW): Bayesian statistics, statistical inference.
* [BeerAdvocate data analysis](https://github.com/wzbillings/rust-raven): Exploratory data analysis, web scraping, data visualization.
* [`zlib` R package](https://github.com/wzbillings/zlib): `R` package development, miscellaneous things.
* [`bardr` R package](https://github.com/wzbillings/bardr): `R` package development, data cleaning and wrangling, text data processing, **CRAN submission process**.
* [LASSO code example](https://github.com/wzbillings/LASSO-Code-Example): LASSO, statistical theory, regression methods, `R` and `tidymodels`. I recommend looking at the presentation or the code example here.
* [`HMBGR` `R` package](https://github.com/wzbillings/HMBGR): `R` package development, regression modeling. I wish I could say differential equations but I'm not sure this really shows off my ODE knowledge at all.
* [Grain price analysis, original version](https://github.com/wzbillings/Corn-Price-Analysis): generalized least squares regression, data visualization, statistical inference, regression modeling, data cleaning and wrangling.
* [Numerical analysis scripts](https://github.com/wzbillings/Numerical-Analysis): MATLAB programming, numerical computing.
* [Mathematical modeling projects](https://github.com/wzbillings/Math_430): Mathematica, ordinary differential equations, mathematical modeling.
* [Titanic analysis](https://github.com/wzbillings/titanic): Data visualization, I guess. Everyone has done a titanic analysis and this is supposed to be a comprehensive list of my available work.
