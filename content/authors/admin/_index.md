Zane Billings is a PhD student working with Andreas Handel at the University of Georgia (Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics). He has experience in R programming, scientific computing, and data analysis. Previously, Zane obtained his undergraduate degree in mathematics and biology at Western Carolina University, where his research primarily focused on modulation of the autophagy pathway by keratin proteins. Now he has transitioned to more theoretical work, focusing on data analytics related to the seasonal influenza vaccine.

Zane has participated in two REU programs, [Math-Biology at UNCG](http://www.uncg.edu/mat/bio-math/REU/people.html) and [Population Biology of Infectious Diseases at UGA](http://reu.ecology.uga.edu/). Additionally, Zane was the TA for a course on scientific computing for three semesters at WCU. He currently works in [Dr. Andreas Handel's research group](http://handelgroup.publichealth.uga.edu/).
