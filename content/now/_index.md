# What is Zane doing right now?

As of **April 2, 2022** this is what I am working on.

## My projects

* My main area of interest continues to be the immune response to the seasonal flu vaccine. I'm still doing a lot of exploratory data analysis and figuring out the best way to quantify immune responses to different flu strains after vaccination.
* An especially interesting question to me right now is determining how well past vaccines have protected against future (well, they are past now) strains.
* I'm trying to get through *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath. Unfortunately, I've been sufficiently indoctrinated by frequentist methods and I'm having some difficulties, so I've taken a temporary hiatus to read *Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way*.
* Trying to find every norovirus challenge study that's ever been conducted through systematic searching and citation dredging.
* 

## Collaborations

* My colleague [Yang Ge](https://yangepi.github.io/) fit some Bayesian models using `brms`. I'm converting the code to the `rethinking` package, and also providing what limited advice I can about his models. We're working on a few projects about norovirus (vaccines) and one about seasonal influenza vaccines.
* I'm working with [Skarlet Velasquez](https://publichealth.uga.edu/student/skarlet-velasquez/) on analyzing the relationship between a certain type of environmental chemical exposure and preterm births in Puerto Rico.
* Making a lot of figures for a longitudinal analysis of influenza immune response trajectories. Most of the paper and analysis is being done by [Meng-Hsuan Sung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meng-hsuan-sung-bba0b2228/?trk=public_profile_browsemap).

## Service commitments

* I am the president of GSEB (Graduate Scholars of Epidemiology and Biostats) and I spend at least an hour a week organizing events and that kind of thing.
* I'm on my department's curriculum committee and we're currently working on some revisions to our courses and degree competencies.

## Other stuff

* I'm not teaching right now (or recently), but I am planning to mentor a student for this year's [Population Biology of Infectious Disease](https://reu.ecology.uga.edu/) REU!
* [Trying to read when I get a chance](https://www.goodreads.com/wzbillings):
  - *Getting what you came for: The smart student's guide to getting a PhD* by Robert Peters
  - *The priory of the orange tree* by Samantha Shannon
* Trying to find a new set of glasses frames that I like and can afford.
