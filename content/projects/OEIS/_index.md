The On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is a database for mathematicians to look up sequences of integer numbers which may be of interest. I first learned about the OEIS when I took a discrete mathematics class with [Andrew Penland](https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/adpenland.aspx) at Western Carolina University. One of the homework assignments was to come up with a rule for an integer sequence, and when I did this, I discovered that my sequence was not previously known! (For a young mathematician, this is exciting, even if it does not sound that way.) I discovered one similar sequence, and contributed code to a third. Maybe one day in the future I will discover some more. For now, this is on the back burner, but I have listed the sequences I've discovered or contributed to below.

* [A319302](http://oeis.org/A319302): author. (This is the sequence I discovered in my undergraduate class.)
* [A309092](http://oeis.org/A309092): author.
* [A110529](http://oeis.org/A110529): contributed Python code and b-file.
