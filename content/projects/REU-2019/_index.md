In Summer 2019, I participated in the Population Biology of Infectious Diseases REU site held by the Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. I worked with Andreas Handel and Brian McKay on a project analyzing whether relative viral load is an indicator of symptom severity and prognosis for influenza. This project was when I really got interested in influenza research, and Andreas apparently liked my work enough to let me work with him during my PhD also. Hopefully I've lived up to his expectations! You can find my final poster below. The black box is some text that Roche "asked" us to redact.
