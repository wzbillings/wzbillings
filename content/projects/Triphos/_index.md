**Under construction!!!** I lost the files I wanted to link on my external drive but they will be updated as soon as I can find them.

As part of my math degree at Western Carolina University, I completed a capstone course in Fall 2019. I choose to focus on Triphosian numbers, inspired by [this paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0025570X.2019.1609293), which had been published in Mathematics Magazine about a month before I started my project. You can find my final paper [here](), and my slides are [here]() as well as embedded below.

Ideally my new results would be published someday, but it hasn't been at the top of my to-do list for a while now.
