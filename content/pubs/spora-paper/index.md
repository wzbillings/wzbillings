abstract: In 1954, Armitage and Doll published one of the most influential papers in the history of mathematical epidemiology. However, when one examines the literature one finds that there are in fact at least three distinct mathematical models attributed to the 1954 paper. In this study, we examine this important paper and the mathematical derivation of their model. We find, very surprisingly, that no stochastic process can account for all the assumptions of the model and that many of the models in the literature use a consistent subset of the assumptions used in Armitage and Doll's paper.

summary: In Summer 2019, I participated in the Population Biology of Infectious Disease REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) site at the Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. I worked with Andreas Handel and Brian McKay on a project which eventually became this paper! We found that influenza viral load did not appear to be associated with symptoms or recovery in a specific cohort.

This is a paper that I contribute to during my undergrad math degree at Western Carolina University. Remember that in math papers, the authors are alphabetical, and we all contributed equally to the paper.

You can find the paper [online here](https://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/spora/vol8/iss1/3).
