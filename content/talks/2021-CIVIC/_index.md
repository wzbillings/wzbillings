abstract: Post-vaccination fold change in HAI titer (a correlate of protection for influenza immunity) appears to have a negative linear relationship with pre-vaccination titer. However, the effect of vaccine dose does not appear to be consistent with mechanistic model predictions, and we also notice an effect of age, which is not accounted for by previous models.

I presented a poster at the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease conference in 2021. The conference was supposed to be held in Montpellier, France, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic was held virtually in gather.town. That was an interesting experience.

The poster can be found [here](/posters/CIVIC-Annual-2021-slides.pdf), and is also embedded below. We are continuing our exploration of vaccine cohort data to determine what mechanistic model predictions can be verified by data, and what aspects of mechanistic models may need to be adapted.
