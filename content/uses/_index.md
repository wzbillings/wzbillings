# Uses

This is a list of everything I use that I could think of to list here.

## Hardware

I actually have three hardware setups. It's kind of annoying and a big reason that I use Git for everything--more on that later.

* In my **office** I use a Dell pre-built that I do not know the Dell name for with Windows 10 Enterprise. The processor is an Intel Core i9-10980XE 3.00 GHz. 64gb RAM. The GPU is an AMD Radeon Pro WX 2100.
* In my **house** I use a Dell pre-built [update the rest of this when I get home].
* **On the go** I use a 2017 Macbook with the retina screen. It was great for carrying all around in undergrad but I find it very underwhelming for the price point now.
* My **phone** is a Samsung Galaxy A50, and I have notifications disabled for emails and Slack, and most of my group texts muted. I leave it on do-not-disturb and the only people who bypass DnD are my parents and sister.

## Coding
* I almost exclusively use `R` these days.
* Sometimes recently I use `Stan`, but I've never written my own bespoke `Stan` code, only used `R` code that generates `Stan` code.
* My preferred IDE is RStudio. I use the "Vibrant Ink" theme that is packaged with the IDE.
* In the past I've used python with atom and MATLAB with the GUI.
* On windows, I exclusively use git bash as my terminal. On MacOS, I use the built-in terminal with bash.
* I use Anonymous Pro as my preferred coding font.

## Workflow / writing
* I use Git and GitHub for nearly everything. Almost all of my new projects (even small things) start by creating an R project with a git repo.
* Speaking of R projects, I use a `.rproj` file to organize anything I will do that will involve any amount of R code.
* For almost all of my research-related writing, I use R Markdown, which is an implementation of pandoc-flavored markdown that can integrate code and the results from running code.
* For course projects that require me to use SAS or don't involve coding, I use LaTeX. I use [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) for my distribution and [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for my editor.
* I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for almost all of my reference management, although I've unfortunately been forced to use EndNote (which I will not provide a link to as I do not endorse it or Clarivate) recently.
* I use bibtex for all of my bibliographies as it works seamlessly with both pandoc and LaTeX.
* I use [WinCompose](http://wincompose.info/) for typing most special characters on Windows.
* I use google drive for anything non-code-related that I need to share. One day I'll consider switching to Quarto when collaborative editing is out, but that isn't today. If anyone knows a good markdown alternative, let me know.
* I use Powerpoint, which I dislike, for making presentations. But I find every other alternative to be even more cumbersome than powerpoint for making slides that look nice. Beamer and presentations with R Markdown are both more difficult to use than I think is worthwhile.

## Other software
* In the past I've used Mathematica, but apparently Julia can do everything that Mathematica can do, so I don't recommend that anyone pay money for Mathematica.
* I'm also pretty good at SAS, but I will never buy a SAS license. Whenever I am forced to use SAS, I use SAS OnDemand for Academics. However, if you are a SAS user, I recommend pivoting away from SAS.
* I do not like using Microsoft Office. But I often find myself using Outlook and OneNote because figuring out anything else would take me time that I do not currently have.
* I use Firefox as my main browser, and I use google chrome when print to PDF in Firefox doesn't work. Chrome is also required for some `R`/`pandoc` procedures for turning HTML into PDF.
* This website is created with `blogdown`, with source code on GitHub, and deployed by Netlify.
* I manage all my passwords with [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/).
* My time and project management skills are very bad. I use a system cobbled together from OneNote, Outlook's calendar, sticky notes in the office, and random scribblings on a notepad to manage what I need to get done. Usually it does not work very well, but I've never found a system that works better for me.
