PERSONAL SUMMARY: I am currently a PhD student working under Andreas Handel at
the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. In the future, I hope to continue
doing academic research. My main research interests are in statistical methods
(including modeling and data analytics) applied to the immunology and
epidemiology of influenza, and my current work is on drivers of immune response
to the seasonal influenza vaccine at the host level. More broadly, I am
interested in the application of statistical methods to public health,
especially in relation to viruses and vaccines. I am proficient with the R
programming language, and write all of my analysis code in R.
